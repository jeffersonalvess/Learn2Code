Learn2Code is an web2py web application developed as final project to DePaul University CSC 333 class as a prototype for a largest future project.

What is Learn2Code about?
-------------
Learn2Code idea comes from a conversation with a friend of mine some time ago. He had the idea to create a web application to help freshman students how to code. He worked as a tutor on his university and he felt that some of the tools available are not enough, and sometimes complicated to some students. Another complication is the language barrier, most of these sites are available only in English and students from countries that doesnâ€™t have English as the main language usually struggle even more to learn.
